# Scientific-Computing-using-Julia

Developed and implemented Julia scripts to simulate various physical systems, showcasing proficiency in scientific computing and numerical analysis. The projects included:

* Bergman Model: Simulated glucose-insulin interactions to study diabetes dynamics.
* Robertson Model: Implemented stiff differential equations to analyze chemical kinetics.
* Spring Mass Damper System: Modeled and solved second-order differential equations to investigate mechanical vibrations.
* Pendulum Dynamics: Simulated the motion of a simple pendulum, demonstrating non-linear differential equation solving.

These simulations involved formulating the mathematical models, using DifferentialEquations.jl for numerical solutions, and visualizing the results with Plots.jl.
